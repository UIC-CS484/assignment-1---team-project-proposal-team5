                The target audience of the website is everyone who listens to music, wants to know the lyrics to the song and open to new song recommendations <br>

                <br>Goals:<br>
                1) It can be really tough finding the lyrics to the song without knowing the song name. Our primary goal is to display synchronised lyrics to the user ad-free.<br>
                2) Allow the user to explore songs from the similar genre and generate accurate recommendation based on their mood and the genre of song they are currently playing.<br>
                3) Our other goals include allowing the user to see and interact with the artist's name, artist's upcoming shows and upcoming albums.<br>
                <br>
                We decided to go with this project as most of the music listeners now-a-days struggle with finding synchronised lyrics to the song. It is also harder to get good song recommendations, discover artist's albums and upcoming shows. We plan to make it easier for the user to have all the mentioned functionality in one place itself.
