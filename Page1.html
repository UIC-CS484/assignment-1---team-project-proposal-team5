            <h4>RESTFul API</h4>

            <p>
                We plan to use the following Restful APIs for the project:<br>
                MusixMatch REST API - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/musixmatch-rest-api <br>
                Unofficial Shazam API - https://www.programmableweb.com/api/unofficial-shazam <br>
                Spotify API - https://rapidapi.com/stefan.skliarov/api/Spotify/ <br>
            <br>
                The data we get from the APIs will help us display the lyrics to the user. We will also get the genre of the music from the APIs data which we will use to generate a song recommendation list. We also plan to get the artist from the APIs and get their upcoming shows to display to the user.

                <br>
                <br>
                We will collect data regarding what they are listening right now and their current location. Both these things will help to give the user better recommendations and a better user experience overall.
                <br>
                <br>

                We will be using fname, lname, dob, email, password, location, genres and some other entities in our database.

            <h4>Target Audience</h4>

            <p>
                The target audience of the website is everyone who listens to music, wants to know the lyrics to the song and open to new song recommendations
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                1) It can be really tough finding the lyrics to the song without knowing the song name. Our primary goal is to display synchronised lyrics to the user ad-free.<br>
                2) Allow the user to explore songs from the similar genre and generate accurate recommendation based on their mood and the genre of song they are currently playing.<br>
                3) Our other goals include allowing the user to see and interact with the artist's name, artist's upcoming shows and upcoming albums.<br>
                <br>
                We decided to go with this project as most of the music listeners now-a-days struggle with finding synchronised lyrics to the song. It is also harder to get good song recommendations, discover artist's albums and upcoming shows. We plan to make it easier for the user to have all the mentioned functionality in one place itself.

                <h4>Concerns</h4>
                <p>
                    We were wondering if there are any more functionalities we can add to the website.<br>
                    We would also like to know if there are better APIs to find the upcoming shows for a given artists and then display them on a google map with respect to the user's current location.<br>
