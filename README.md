Team Workflow Strategy
======================
-------------------------
* We will be using one main branch, one experiment/staging branch and one personal branch for each member.
* Each member will pull from the main branch, work on it. After completing their respective tasks
  the person will push the updated work onto the experiment/staging branch.
* The other members will then pull from the staging branch and test
  the code.
* If the code is working then we will push the staging branch onto the main branch.
* The member who has to work next will then work his own branch after pulling from the staging
  branch.
* To make it more concise, we will only be pushing onto the main branch. We will work in our personal
  branches after pulling from the staging branch.
* We are going to have weekly meetings on discord.
